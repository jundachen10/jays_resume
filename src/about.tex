%about me

{

    Scaled a startup product to 3 million gig workers, many of whom were Instacart shoppers. As an Uber driver, I saw firsthand how the gig economy supports vulnerable communities by offering both income and access. With self-driven technical bootcamp training, my unique experiences as a user and technologist, I'm eager to join Instacartâ€™s APM program, changing the way we access food and goods.
