%about me

{
    % Scaled a product to 1M users at Gridwise.io and led AI adoption for 10K employees at Highmark Health enGen. Ex-Uber driver with firsthand gig economy experience, now a rising tech professional passionate about building solutions for customers, gig workers, retailers, and advertisers. Completed 2 software bootcamps. Eager to bring my customer empathy, unique experiences, and growth mindset to Instacart’s APM program to help transform the grocery industry and make food more accessible for all.

    Scaled a startup product to 3 million gig workers, many of whom were Instacart shoppers. As an Uber driver, I saw firsthand how the gig economy supports vulnerable communities by offering both income and access. With self-driven technical bootcamp training, my unique experiences as a user and technologist, I'm eager to join Instacart’s APM program, changing the way we access food and goods.
