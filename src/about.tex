%about me

{
    % Scaled a product to 1M users at Gridwise.io and led AI adoption for 10K employees at Highmark Health enGen. Ex-Uber driver with firsthand gig economy experience, now a rising tech professional passionate about building solutions for customers, gig workers, retailers, and advertisers. Completed 2 software bootcamps. Eager to bring my customer empathy, unique experiences, and growth mindset to Instacart’s APM program to help transform the grocery industry and make food more accessible for all.

    Scaled Gridwise.io’s product to 3 million gig workers, including Instacart shoppers, mirroring aspects of Instacart’s multifaceted marketplace. As an Uber driver, I saw firsthand how the gig economy supports vulnerable communities—offering both income and essentials. With self-driven technical bootcamp training, I’m eager to bring my user empathy and technical expertise to Instacart’s APM program, enhancing access to food and goods for all.
